The time::chrono module provides timescale utilities, and the foundations for
chronology with the [[moment]] type, an abstract, extendable date/time object.
For the Gregorian chronology, see the [[time::date::]] module.

Hare defines a chronology as a system for naming and ordering moments in time.
In practice, it is the combination of a calendar and wall clock. This module
implements a simple date & time chronology with [[moment]], which observes
certain chronological values according to its [[locality]]. The observer
functions [[daydate]], [[daytime]], and [[mzone]] obtain these values.
Use [[in]] to localize a moment to another [[locality]]; consult [[tz]].

The [[timescale]] interface facilitates leap-second aware [[convert]]ion of
[[time::instant]]s. The [[tai]] timescale is the default intermediary timescale.
