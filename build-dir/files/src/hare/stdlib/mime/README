The mime module implements a subset of RFC 2045, namely the subset necessary to
handle parsing and encoding Media Types (formerly "MIME types"), and to map them
with file extensions.

This module implements a "reasonable subset" of the specification which aims to
address contemporary use-cases of Media Types outside of the broader context of
the Content-Type header as it's used by emails. The implementation should not
parse any Media Types which are not conformant, but may not parse all conformant
Media Types.
