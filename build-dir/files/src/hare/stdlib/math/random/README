math::random provides a pseudorandom number generator, which yields a
deterministic sequence of psuedo-random numbers based on a seed value.

Beware! This module is NOT suitable for generating genuinely random data for
cryptographic use. See [[crypto::random::]] for cryptographically secure random
number generation.
