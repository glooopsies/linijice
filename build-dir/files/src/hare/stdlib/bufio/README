bufio provides an [[io::stream]] implementation which provides buffered I/O
support, utility functions which pair well with buffered streams, and a
[[scanner]] type which allocates and maintains its own read buffer.

A buffered [[stream]] is used to batch read and write operations against an
underlying [[io::handle]]. bufio provides several utilities for reading from
handles, namely [[read_tok]] et al. These functions require small, frequent
reads, or take advantage of look-ahead, and thus are most efficient when paired
with a buffered [[stream]].

bufio also provides a "scanning" interface, with functions like [[scan_string]]
which take in a [[scanner]]. Strings returned from scanning functions are
borrowed from the scanner's read buffer, so allocated memory can be reused for
future scans.
