This module provides Chacha20-Poly1305 and XChacha20-Poly1305 stream
implementations as described in RFC 8439.

A stream is created with [[chachapoly]]. [[init]] initializes a stream as a
Chacha20-Poly1305 one where [[xinit]] will initialize it as a
XChacha20-Poly1305 stream. After initializiation data can be encrypted by
writing to or decrypted by reading from the stream. The user must call [[seal]]
when encryption is done to create the authentication tag and [[verify]] in case
of decryption to check if the dercypted data is valid. If the data is invalid
it must not be processed further.

This is a low-level module which implements cryptographic primitives. Direct use
of cryptographic primitives is not recommended for non-experts, as incorrect use
of these primitives can easily lead to the introduction of security
vulnerabilities. Non-experts are advised to use the high-level operations
available in the top-level [[crypto::]] module.

Be advised that Hare's cryptography implementations have not been audited.
