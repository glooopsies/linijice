This module implements the bcrypt password hash based on Bruce Schneier's
blowfish. This is a legacy algorithm which is not recommended for new users.

This is a low-level module which implements cryptographic primitives. Direct use
of cryptographic primitives is not recommended for non-experts, as incorrect use
of these primitives can easily lead to the introduction of security
vulnerabilities. Non-experts are advised to use the high-level operations
available in the top-level [[crypto::]] module.

Be advised that Hare's cryptography implementations have not been audited.
