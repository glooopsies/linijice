The crypto::blowfish module provides an implementation of Bruce Schneier's
Blowfish encryption standard via the [[crypto::cipher::block]] interface. The
use of this algorithm is not recommended except for legacy use-cases; prefer
[[crypto::aes::]] when possible.

When combined with a block cipher mode from [[crypto::cipher::]], suitable
buffer lengths for static allocation are provided as constants such as
[[BLOCKSZ]].

This is a low-level module which implements cryptographic primitives. Direct use
of cryptographic primitives is not recommended for non-experts, as incorrect use
of these primitives can easily lead to the introduction of security
vulnerabilities. Non-experts are advised to use the high-level operations
available in the top-level [[crypto::]] module.

Be advised that Hare's cryptography implementations have not been audited.
