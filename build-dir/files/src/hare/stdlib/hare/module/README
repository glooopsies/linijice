hare::module provides an interface to the module system used by this Hare
implementation, as well as to the Hare cache. Note that these interfaces may not
be portable to other Hare implementations.

Note that much of this module's design is an implementation detail of the Hare
toolchain, and is not subject to any future compatibility guarantees.
