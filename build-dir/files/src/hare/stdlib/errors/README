The errors module provides a number of error types which describe error
conditions common to many types of code, as well as convenience functions for
turning these errors into strings, and an error type which may be used to wrap
some implementation-defined error data. If your program's error cases can be
modelled by the errors offered in this module, you may use them to make your
error types compatible with a wider range of support modules.
