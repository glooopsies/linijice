memio provides implementations of [[io::stream]] which can read from or write to
byte slices. [[fixed]] uses a caller-supplied buffer for storage, while
[[dynamic]] uses a dynamically allocated buffer which will grow instead of
erroring when writing past the end of the buffer. All memio streams are
seekable; the read-write head works the same way as an operating system file.
You can access the contents of the buffer via [[buffer]] and [[string]].

Additionally, memio provides string-related I/O operations. Each of the utility
functions (e.g. [[appendrune]]) work correctly with any [[io::handle]], but
for efficiency reasons it is recommended that they are either a memio:: or
[[bufio::]] stream.
