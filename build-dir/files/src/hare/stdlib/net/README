The net module provides some general-purpose interfaces and support code, but
generally users are directed to the submodules, where implementations of
various network protocols are provided, such as [[net::tcp::]] or
[[net::dns::]].

A porcelain API for establishing an outgoing connection, able to automatically
handle matters such as DNS resolution, is available at [[net::dial::]].
