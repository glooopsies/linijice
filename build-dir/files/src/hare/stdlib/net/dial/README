net::dial provides a single function to facilitate the establishment of outgoing
network connections. It handles port selection, address parsing, protocol and
service lookup, DNS lookup (via /etc/hosts, /etc/resolv.conf, etc), SRV record
resolution, and so on. See [[dial]] for details.

Modules implementing their own network protocols are also able to add themselves
to the protocol and service registry. The protocol registry is used for
transport-level protocols (such as TCP) and is managed via [[registerproto]];
the service registry is used for application-level protocols (such as SSH) and
is managed via [[registersvc]].

Some useful functions for IP-related protocols to interpret the "addr" parameter
of the dial function are also provided, namely [[resolve]].
