The endian module provides support functions for converting the byte encoding
("endianness") of integers. The following abbreviations are used throughout the
module:

- be - big endian; most significant byte first
- le - little endian; least significant byte first
- h - the endianness of the host system
- n - the endianness of the network (big endian)
