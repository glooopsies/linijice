Implementation of the base32 encoding scheme as defined by RFC 4648.

A stream-based encoding and decoding interface is available via [[newencoder]]
and [[newdecoder]], which transparently encode or decode bytes to or from base32
when writing to or reading from an underlying I/O handle.

Convenience functions for encoding to or decoding from a byte slice or a string
are also available; see [[encodeslice]], [[decodeslice]], [[encodestr]], and
[[decodestr]]. These functions dynamically allocate their return values; use the
stream interface if you require static allocation.

Each function accepts the desired base32 encoding alphabet as its first
argument. [[std_encoding]] and [[hex_encoding]], as defined by the RFC, are
provided for your convenience, but you may create your own encoding using
[[encoding_init]].

Due to security concerns described by the RFC, this implementation rejects
invalid padding.
