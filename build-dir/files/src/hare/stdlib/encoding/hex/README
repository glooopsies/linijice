This module implements hexadecimal encoding and decoding.

A stream-based encoding and decoding interface is available via [[newencoder]]
and [[newdecoder]], which transparently encode or decode bytes to or from
hexadecimal representation when writing to or reading from an underlying I/O
handle.

Convenience functions for encoding a byte slice into a hexadecimal string or
decoding from a string into a byte slice are also available; see [[encodestr]]
and [[decodestr]]. These functions dynamically allocate their return values; use
the stream interface if you require static allocation.

Note that writes are always encoded as lowercase hexidecimal characters, but the
functions in this module can decode both upper- and lower-case hexidecimal
characters.
